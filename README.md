# Tumblr Ruby Gem

This is a ruby wrapper for the Tumblr v2 API. There should be support for all endpoints
currently available on the [Tumblr API]('http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2').

## Installation

It hasn't been submitted to ruby gems yet so you'll have to build your gem first. 
```
gem build tumblr.gemspec
```

Then you can just install with:
```
gem install tumblr-0.5.gem
```
